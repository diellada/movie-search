# Movie search app using OMBD API

This project uses the OMDB API in order to retrive information on dfferent movies, then displays them in a card format with poster, title and year. This is done through searching for a particular title, and titles searched can be filtered by year.

Further improvements are to be able to add favourites to a list and for a local machine to store this information every time a user goes back onto the page.
